What is Jail Broking

    Jailbreaking means removing software restrictions built into iPhones and other iOS devices. 

==========================================================
what is Jail break and Mitigation
=========================================================

modifying certain files, intercepting system calls, or patching specific code segments within the app

Is that Jail breaking device detective is not configured in ios device, how to mitigate this obserbasion?

    Keep your iOS device updated:
    Disable automatic software updates:
    Be cautious with third-party apps and repositories: 
    Avoid clicking on suspicious links or installing unknown profiles:
    Regularly review and revoke app permissions: 
    Enable Find My iPhone/iPad: 
    Be mindful of device physical security:

What is SSL Pinning?
    SSL pinning is a technique that helps to prevent MITM attacks by hardcoding the SSL/TLS certificate’s public key into the app or device. This means that when the app or device communicates with the server, it will compare the server’s SSL/TLS certificate’s public key with the one that is hardcoded into the app or device.

========================================
SSL pinning on IOS and Mitigation:
=======================================
    Use a robust SSL pinning library
    Implement certificate pinning
    Protect the SSL pinning configuration
    Apply code obfuscation
    Anti-tampering mechanisms
    Jailbreak detection and response
    Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence
    Regularly update SSL pinning implementation
    Secure software development practices
